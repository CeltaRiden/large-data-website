##Chosen Direction

I have chosen to go with visual style 2. 
I'm targeting young and old viewers so the style has to be youthful but at the same time well designed for a more mature audience to take it seriosuly. I want my viewers to feel comfortable and relaxed when they come to my site and are able to navigate around with ease for an overall enjoyable experience while researching and discovering more about herbs. It's a fun layout that I'm going to really enjoy putting together. I choose modern sans serif fonts, *Futura* and *Comfortaa*, with a simple layout. It's a clean modern look that mixes well with the bright earthy tone color pallet and wooden textures.
