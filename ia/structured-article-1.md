## Cooking


*Aloe vera* is a succulent plant species that is found only in cultivation, having no naturally occurring populations, although closely related aloes do occur in northern Africa.[1] The species is frequently cited as being used in herbal medicine since the beginning of the first century AD. Extracts from A. vera are widely used in the cosmetics and alternative medicine industries, being marketed as variously having rejuvenating, healing, or soothing properties. There is, however, little scientific evidence of the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes, and what positive evidence is available is frequently contradicted by other studies.


Preparations made from Aloe vera are often referred to as "aloe vera".[39] Scientific evidence for the cosmetic and therapeutic effectiveness of aloe vera is limited and when present is frequently contradictory.[2][3] Despite this, the cosmetic and alternative medicine industries regularly make claims regarding the soothing, moisturizing, and healing properties of aloe vera.[4][40] Aloe vera gel is used as an ingredient in commercially available lotions, yogurt, beverages, and some desserts,[41][42][43] although at certain doses, it has toxic properties when used either for ingested or topical applications.[44] Other uses for extracts of Aloe vera include the dilution of semen for the artificial fertilization of sheep,[45] as a fresh food preservative,[46] or for water conservation in small farms.[47] It has also been suggested that biofuels could be obtained from Aloe vera seeds.[48] Aloe is also used as a food substance, possibly for its gelling properties.

## Healing

Early records of Aloe vera use appear in the Ebers Papyrus from the 16th century BC,[16] in both Dioscorides' De Materia Medica and Pliny the Elder's Natural History written in the mid-first century AD[16] along with the Juliana Anicia Codex produced in 512 AD.[41] The species is used widely in the traditional herbal medicine of many countries.[4] Aloe vera, called kathalai in Ayurvedic medicine, is used as a multipurpose skin treatment. This may be partly due to the presence of saponin, a chemical compound that acts as an antimicrobial agent.[
