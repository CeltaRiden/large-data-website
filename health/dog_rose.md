## Dog Rose

In ancient times, the wild dog rose was the most popular source of rose hips â€“ tiny fruits related to apples. Rose hips are still a popular ingredient in herbal teas, and are powerhouse sources of vitamin C, iron and antioxidants. If you don't spray your roses, you can harvest the naturally-high-in-pectin hips after the frost and make jam.
