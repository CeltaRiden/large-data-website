## Fattoush 

![Fattoush]({{site.baseurl}}/img/recipes/fattoush.jpg)

A wonderful spread for bagels or crackers, this is creamy and herby, perfect for that ferocious morning hunger when the scrambled eggs aren't quite ready yet.

Serves 4-6

### ingredients
#### for Zatarr
- 30g sesame seeds (raw or toasted)
- 30g sumac
- 2 tbsp dried thyme
- 1 tbsp dried oregano

#### For the fattoush
- 2 medium cucumbers
- 540g tomatoes, chopped 
- 2 red bell peppers
- 1 large red onion
- 3 spring onions
- 25g flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- 20g mint, chopped 
- 2-4 flatbread or pitta, toasted

#### For the dressing
- 65ml extra virgin olive oil
- 65ml freshly squeezed lemon juice
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 tsp honey or maple syrup
- 2-4 garlic cloves, crushed
- Salt and black pepper

### instructions

1. Combine all the zaatar ingredients in a bowl and mix well. (This recipe makes more zaatar than you need: store in a glass jar, in a cool dark place.)

2. Wash, prepare and chop all the veg into bite‑size pieces. Wash, then spin-dry the herbs and chop. Place in a large bowl.

3. Put all the dressing ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake. Pour over the salad, stir, and let stand for at least 30 minutes at room temperature to allow the flavours to combine.

4. Before serving, sprinkle generously with zaatar, tear the flatbread or toasted pitta into bite‑size chunks and fold into the salad.
