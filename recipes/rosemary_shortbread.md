## Rosemary shortbread 

![Rosemary shortbread](rosemary-shortbread.jpg)

The buttery nature of shortbread lends itself to being flavoured by herbs. Instead of rosemary, try this with lavender or lemon thyme. Wash the herbs and dry thoroughly before use. The orange zest brings out the spicy notes of rosemary, but you could also use lemon zest.

Makes 12 

### ingredients

- 55g caster sugar, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp rosemary leaves, finely chopped 
- 115g butter, softened
- Finely grated zest of 1 orange
70g plain flour, sifted

### instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Lightly grease a baking tray.

2. Put the sugar and rosemary in a food processor. Whizz until the rosemary is very finely chopped, then add the butter and orange zest and whizz until pale and creamy. Transfer to a large bowl. Beat in the flour until it forms a stiff dough.

3. Place the dough on a sheet of baking paper and cover with another sheet. Gently press down with a rolling pin and roll out to 3-5mm thick. Lift off the top sheet of paper and stamp out the biscuits with a 7cm-diameter pastry cutter. Using a palette knife, lift them off the paper and carefully transfer to the baking sheet. Lightly combine the remaining dough pieces together and repeat the process.

4. Prick the biscuits with a fork and bake for 12 minutes or until tinged a very pale brown. Using a palette knife (they will still be soft), transfer to a wire rack and liberally dust with caster sugar. Serve once cool and crisp.
