## Wilted Herb Salad 

![Wilted Herb Salad](wilted-herb-salad.jpg)

Wild Moroccan herbs are the inspiration for this dish, but at home, try this mixture of parsley, coriander, spinach and rocket. If you know where to find them, you can add a handful of edible, foraged seasonal leaves, such as mallow, sorrel, poppy and dandelion.

Serves 4

### ingredients

- 2 large bunches flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked from the stalks
- 2 large bunches fresh coriander, leaves and stalks
- 100g rocket
- 100g spinach, shredded
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
- ½ tsp ground cumin
- ¼ preserved lemon, rind only, washed and finely chopped, or the juice - of ½ lemon (optional)

### instructions

1. Chop the herbs and spinach together.

2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and gently fry for a few seconds until it begins to colour. Add the ground cumin and fry for 10 seconds.

3. Stir in the herbs and continue to cook until the herbs wilt, then stir in the preserved lemon rind or juice and taste for seasoning. Preserved lemons have quite a strong flavour and can be salty, so bear this in mind when you adjust.

4. Serve on its own, or with yoghurt seasoned with a little garlic, or on top of hummus and spiced lamb.
