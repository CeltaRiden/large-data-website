## Garden herb spread 

![Garden Herb Spread](garden-herb-spread.jpg)

A wonderful spread for bagels or crackers, this is creamy and herby, perfect for that ferocious morning hunger when the scrambled eggs aren't quite ready yet.

Makes around 500g

### ingredients

- 60g raw cashews
- 1 garlic clove, chopped
- 450g firm tofu, drained
- 2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh thyme
- 1 tbsp fresh tarragon
- 2 tbsp fresh oregano, chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 30g red onion, chopped
- ¼ tsp salt
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- Salt and black pepper

### instructions

1. In a blender, blitz the cashews into coarse crumbs. Add the garlic and pulse to incorporate. Crumble in the tofu. Blend until relatively smooth. Add everything else and pulse. You don't want the onion and herbs to completely puree – they should be chopped into small bits.

2. You can serve immediately, but it's best when it has been chilled for at least 30 minutes.
